## When to use

- Used for selecting a selection from an array of options
- Using just one checkbox is similar to using the Toggle component although the checkbox uses an Input tag that needs to be submitted

## Installing

Import the component

```js
import { Checkbox } from '@supabase/ui'
```

## Basic

You can use a single checkbox alone, with just a `label`. You can then use the prop `onChange` for change events.

<CodeSample sample="CheckboxBasic" v="0" />

## Controlled checkbox

### ⚠️ This doesn't work at the moment

Requires value to be used in Checkbox.Group so that component can be controlled by React state.

! Also there is no DefaultValue

<CodeSample sample="CheckboxControlled" v="0" />

## Grouped checkboxes

Checkboxes allow for multiple selections so they are sometimes used in part of a group. You can wrap Checkboxes in a subcomponent called `<Checkbox.Group>`.

You can use the `onChange` prop on either the group subcomponent or the `Checkbox` components individually.

<CodeSample sample="CheckboxGrouped" v="0" />
